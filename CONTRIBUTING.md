## How can you help?

While a majority of the course has been documented using Google Docs there is a long way to go before it can be truly open. This is a place to start to capture all the things that need to be done to make the documentation more visible so people can start commenting on not just the content but also the Information Architecture of how things have been organized.

The following is a link to [Mozilla's Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) that we will abide by.

### Publish content on Github or another open platform
- Content currently lives in Google Drive and Google Docs but we need a platform that better affords collaboration.
- Add Powerpoint/Keynote slide decks to respective folders
- Add Editable Word files to respective Assignments folders
- Add some notes on 3D modeling in Week 5
- Add notes on working with accelerometer during Week 7
- Refine notes on Final Project facilitation and grading

### Generalize the curriculum so it is not just Georgia Tech specific
E.g. in places it references resources on the GT campus, we could either strip those details or de-emphasize them

### Proofreading and Attribution
Proofread material to make sure content reads well and that all links work. There are instances where other work may have been referenced and needs to be cited properly.

### Improved Information Architecture based on feedback from makers, curriculum designers
Need design research to obtain feedback on the existing IA of the course material.

### Create activity sheets/handouts for existing assignments
Some portions of the course have in-class activities that need step by step instructions. Here is a [sample design](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BwLVd0W-_5qwRlltMmNJVTNUSTQ) that has already been created that can be used to fit other activities.

### Testing in the wild!
Have someone actually use the curriculum or portions of the curriculum in a class or workshop form
