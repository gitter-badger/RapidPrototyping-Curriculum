# Rapid Prototyping Course Plan

This repo is a course plan documenting a maker-oriented Introduction to Programming course at Georgia Tech CS-6452.
The course has been pioneered by the following team at Georgia Tech: 
- Gregory Abowd
- Aman Parnami
- Elizabeth DiSalvo
- Zane Cochran

It's now being redeveloped into a general-use repository by Manasvi Lalwani, who has acted as a Teaching Assistant for the course in the past, in partnership with [Mozilla](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#maker-learning-curriculum-for-rapid-prototyping), but in the meantime, you can get started with this:
1. Start with the [Course Overview Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wv5CLz1mf0-Lxyammcyn7AI1M7WV4porr7C6DplU5LA/edit?usp=sharing). This is a lengthy document and the outline should pop-up in the sidebar automatically. But in case it does not, go to Add Ons>>Table of Contents>>Show in sidebar. Pay special attention to [Physical Computing Modules and Milestones](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wv5CLz1mf0-Lxyammcyn7AI1M7WV4porr7C6DplU5LA/edit#heading=h.nfm85m4oqj9) as it links to major milestones in the class such as assignment prompts and sample student work.
2. Read [Class Philosophies and Mindset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LF5SmpCjfAb4eAkxkYvKwMXbwxLkWFatmLKEB3UIAts/edit?usp=sharing) as it shows higher level concepts that need to be kept in mind throughout the course this document also links to some of the [final physical computing projects](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwLVd0W-_5qwVnRocWpKdlJUbjA&usp=sharing).
3. Refer to the [Week by Week Class Outline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwLVd0W-_5qwdFplNERLYXlkTWc/view?usp=sharing) for a more detailed agenda for  8 weeks of Physical Computing
4. Find detailed notes in the [Curriculum Planning folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwLVd0W-_5qwRG52RnJRY3JMSnM&usp=sharing) that correspond to the Weeks outlined in the previous document. Some lessons have supplementary video resources that can be viewed to see a demonstration of a technique in our class.
5. There are also supplementary Powerpoints that can be used in-class. These are yet to be added to the Weekly folders but they do exist as a teaching resource.


This class was offered to graduate students from the Masters and PhD program but it can be taught at an udergraduate level too.
This class was offered over the course of Fall semester and taught two major modules: Introduction to Physical Computing and Introduction to Mobile Phone Programming.
This repo focuses purely on the firs module i.e. Intro to Physical Computing.
It contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly. Some of the exercises require use of resources on the Georgia Tech campus. But educators are encouraged to find alternative resources in their community ortweak exercises such that they use readily available resources.
For example, there may be sessions where we use a 3-D printer to prototype a case for a prototype but that can substituted by a manual exercise such as forming a cardboard box case.
Each module should be tailored to the individual class.
It is written by and for education innovators.
